## Day 1: Business Thinking & Data Design
**Focus:** Defined the business context for "CloudFlow" (B2B SaaS) and mapped the revenue leakage scenarios.

* **Status:** ✅ Complete
* **Key Achievements:**
    * Mapped the "Order-to-Cash" operational workflow to identify failure points.
    * Defined 3 critical leakage scenarios:
        1.  **The Ghost Subscriber:** Active users with missing invoices.
        2.  **The Zombie Account:** Non-paying users who were not suspended.
        3.  **The Leaky Bucket:** Partial payments incorrectly marked as settled.
* **Scope Decision:** Confirmed focus is strictly on operational billing failures, not marketing churn.
