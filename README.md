# Revenue Leakage & Subscription Integrity Analysis (WIP)

**Current Status:** 🚧 Active Development (Currently at Day 8)

This repository documents a 15-day project to build, break, and analyze a subscription billing system. If you are looking through this project, follow the path below to understand the logic in the correct order.

### 🗺️ How to Navigate This Project

This project is structured chronologically. To follow the "story," go through the files in this order:

#### Phase 1: The Plan & Design (Start Here)
Before looking at code, read the documentation to understand *what* we are building and *why*.
1.  **Start with the Business Logic:**
    * 📄 Read `docs/day_01_business_logic.md` to see the leakage scenarios (Ghosts, Zombies, Leaky Buckets).
2.  **See the Blueprint:**
    * 📄 Read `docs/day_02_data_design.md` to see the 5-table schema and ER Diagram.
3.  **Understand the "Chaos":**
    * 📄 Read `docs/day_03_data_simulation_logic.md` to see how we planned to break the data intentionally.

#### Phase 2: The Build (Python & Data)
Once you know the plan, look at how we created the synthetic data.
4.  **The Engine:**
    * 🐍 Check `scripts/data_generator.py`. This is the Python script that created the data.
5.  **The Output:**
    * 💾 Look at the `data/` folder. This contains the raw CSVs (`invoices.csv`, `payments.csv`, etc.) generated by the script.

#### Phase 3: The Analysis (SQL)
Now, move to the SQL queries to see the actual detective work.
6.  **Setup & Validation:**
    * 🔍 Run `analysis/SQL/01_schema_and_tables.sql` to build the database.
    * 🔍 Run `analysis/SQL/02_import_validation.sql` to verify the data loaded correctly.
7.  **The Investigation:**
    * 🔍 Run `analysis/SQL/05_forensic_analysis.sql`. This is the core analysis that identifies the specific "Zombie" and "Ghost" users.
    * 📄 Read `docs/day_08_root_cause_analysis.md` for the explanation of these findings.
